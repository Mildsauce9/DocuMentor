[{"question": "what is the core principle of the book?", "answer": "Based on the provided snippets, the core principle of the book appears to be about shifting one's financial paradigm from **working for money to making money work for oneself**.\n\nThis is supported by several points:\n*   The \"rich dad\" advised Robert to \"own the corporation\" rather than \"work for a corporation\" (Page 9).\n*   The book aims to provide \"a valuable insight into the way true investors analyze their investment decisions\" (Page 9).\n*   It contrasts the idea of working for money with learning \"to have money work for you\" (Page 40).\n*   The author hopes the book provides \"some insights into utilizing the power of money to work for you\" (Page 128).\n*   It challenges the traditional advice of encouraging children to be employees, suggesting this leads to paying more taxes with little promise of a pension (Page 10).\n*   It emphasizes that \"Money is only an idea. If you want more money simply change your thinking\" (Page 128).", "sources": [{"page": 9, "content": "For any accountants who read this book, \nsuspend your academic book knowledge and open your mind to the theories Robert \npresents.
