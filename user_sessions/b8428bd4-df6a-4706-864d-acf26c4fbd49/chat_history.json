[{"question": "what is this document about ?", "answer": "This document is about developing an autonomous system to solve a Rubik's Cube. The system aims to solve the puzzle in the minimum number of moves and minimum time by using image processing to recognize the colors on the cube's faces and then applying various algorithms to determine the solution.", "sources": [{"page": 0, "content": "This document has 5 pages and 0 chapters.
